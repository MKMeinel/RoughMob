## File Descriptions

### `<molecule>-RoughVolumes.txt`
This file contains all the volume data measured in cubic Angströms for each molecule. The data is organized as follows:
- **First Row**: Shell volume
- **Second Row**: Overlap volume
- **Third Row**: Inner passive volume
- **Fourth Row**: Outer passive volume
- **Fifth Row**: Molecular volume

### `<molecule>-rAA-rCG-deltaR.txt`
This file includes the average radius of the all-atom surface (rAA), the hard sphere radius of the coarse-grained (CG) bead (rCG), and the molecular roughness difference (Delta R) of pure components. All values are provided in Angströms.
