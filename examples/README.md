# Usage of RoughMob - Examples

This folder contains example scripts demonstrating how to use the RoughMob analysis tools provided in this repository.

## Overview of Examples

1. **Example 1: Molecular Roughness Difference Calculation**
   - This script demonstrates how to calculate the molecular roughness difference for a single CG bead molecules in pure liquids. It includes the calculation of passive and active volumes based on the roughness data.

2. **Example 2: Fit Function Example**
   - This example showcases how to fit a model to the calculated data. It uses the least squares fitting method to correlate active and passive volumes with acceleration factors for pure systems.

3. **Example 3: Acceleration Prediction in a Mixture**
   - The script predicts the acceleration of dynamics in a DiMeBu-DiMeHx mixture. It uses the fit parameters and roughness volumes as determined for pure liquids. 

## Usage

To run these examples:

1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries: NumPy and SciPy.
2. Clone the main repository, and add the repository containing the functions to your PYTHONPATH..
3. Run the scripts using Python. For example, `python3 example1.py`.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
